Apply the application in a website:
-----------------------------------

1. Use index.htm file including all other files that are defined,
	js/jquery-1.3.2-drag-slider.min.js
	js/jquery-ui-1.7-drag-slider.custom.min.js
	css/jquery-ui-1.7-drag-slider.custom.css
	js/excanvas.js
	js/pixastic.custom.js
	js/rotator.js
	js/img_adjust.js
	css/general.css
	js/conf.js
	js/conf_adjust.js

2. In the conf.js set appropriate values to the variables:
	a. img_path, the name of the image.

	b. path, the path of the image in relation to the index.htm file.

	c. img_act_height AND img_act_weight in order to define the size of the frame that the image would be displayed.

	d. max_width, min_width AND step in order to define:
		max_width		-------->	// Max allowable scale for image zoom   |
		min_width		-------->	// Min allowable scale for image zoom   |
		step			-------->	// Scale step for zoom   				|
	The original image is supposed to be of scale 1.

	e. displayRZ AND displayBC in order to include or exclude specific functionality:

		displayZ		-------->	//Set to 'true' if you wanted to display the zoom controls
							//Set to 'false' if you wanted to hide the zoom controls 

		displayR		-------->	//Set to 'true' if you wanted to display the rotate controls
							//Set to 'false' if you wanted to hide the rotate controls 

		displayBC		-------->	//Set to 'true' if you wanted to display the brightness/contrast controls 
							//Set to 'false' if you wanted to hide the brightness/contrast controls


3. For the script js/pixastic.custom.js to work you should place the application inside a web server (apache)

4. You have to comment the DOCTYPE in index.htm in order for the application to work properly in IE7.
