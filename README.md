<b>YAPI Viewer</b> (Yet Another PIcture Viewer) is a web image viewer that can be easily added to any web site. In-line picture editing is also supported. Its implementation is based solely on the canvas element of HTML5, javascript and CSS. It works in all major browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Konqueror. In addition, it offers a range of customisation options to suit the needs of any website.

<b>YAPI Viewer</b> displays your images into a box consisting of specific buttons for zoom/pan and rotation and sliders for brightness/contrast adjustment.

You can view and test <b>YAPI Viewer</b> by navigating in the various digital collections of the PANDEKTIS repository, the digital repository of the National Hellenic Research Foundation containing primary sources of Greek history and culture.
